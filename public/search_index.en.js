free software which respect user Freedom ‘Its free as freedom’ Its means Zero price but we are not taking about price, We talking about more freedom.\nMore precisely, To support defination free software there are four essential freedoms:\n\nThe freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.\nThe freedom to study ,to change and  how the program works.\nThe freedom to redistribute copies When you wish .\nThe freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.\n\n\n“When user control program that’s  free software and When program control user that’s Proprietary Software” - Richard Stallman\n\nwhat is Proprietary Software\nProprietary software, also called nonfree software, means software that doesn’t respect users’ freedom and community.\nA proprietary program puts its developer or owner in a position of power over its users. This power is in itself an injustice.\nFree Software Vs Proprietary Software\nPointsFree SoftwareProprietary Software\nModifyFreedom to change anythingrestrict to change thing\nJailNo censorship on applicationcensorship on application\nDistributionfreely distributecannot freely distribute\nSource CodeHave accessNot have acces\nRun ProgramFree of costpay of cost\nCustomizationHighly customizableLimited customization\n\nFree Software Is Even More Important Now\nWith free software, the users control the program, both individually and collectively. So they control what their computers do\nWith proprietary software, the program controls the users, and some other entity (the developer or “owner”) controls the program\nEven when proprietary software isn’t downright malicious, its developers have an incentive to make it addictive, controlling and manipulative.\nFreedom means having control over your own life.

publishing code is which license to use. Personally, I choose the GNU General Public License v3 (GPLv3) for nearly all of my projects.\nHere’s why, and what you can do if someone tries to steal your code or claim it as their own.\n\nWhy the GPL?\nThe GPL is a copyleft license. That means:\n\nAnyone can run, study, modify, and share your code.\nBut if they redistribute it (modified or not), they must:\n\nKeep your copyright and license notice.\nRelease their modifications under the GPL as well.\n\n\n\nThis ensures that your work stays free and open source forever. No company can legally close-source it, rebrand it, and sell it back to you.\nBy contrast, permissive licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache, etc.) allow redistribution without that requirement. Someone can take your code, hide the source, and profit from it without giving anything back.\n\nyou can read the full GPLv3 text here:\nhttps://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html\nalso check lukesmith.xyz article on\nwhy he uses gpl\ni have added some points from his article below\nWhy Not MIT/BSD? (Inspired by Luke Smith’s “Cuck Licenses” Essay)\nPermissive licenses (commonly referred to as “cuck licenses”) like the MIT license allow others to modify your software and release it under an unfree license. Copyleft licenses (like the Gnu General Public License) mandate that all derivative works remain free.\n\n  \n\nSome developers argue that MIT or BSD licenses are “freer” because they impose fewer restrictions.\nBut as Luke Smith argued in his well-known essay “Why I Use the GPL and Not Cuck Licenses”, permissive licenses often end up serving corporations rather than communities.\nKey takeaways from his perspective:\n\nMIT/BSD are corporate-friendly – They let companies take your code, close it, and profit without giving anything back.\nGPL enforces reciprocity – If someone improves your work, they must share it under the same license.\nFreedom vs exploitation – MIT/BSD give companies the freedom to exploit, while GPL ensures users’ freedom to study, share, and improve software.\nReal-world consequences – For example, MINIX (released under BSD) was silently used inside Intel processors for their Management Engine, now seen as a security risk. If it had been GPL, Intel would’ve had to release the source.\nRespect and protection – GPL enforces credit and sharing. MIT/BSD only rely on goodwill.\n\n\n  \n\nContext:\nAndrew Tanenbaum developed MINIX, a modular operating system kernel. Intel went ahead and used it to build Management Engine, arguably one of the most widespread and invasive pieces of malware in the world, without even as much as telling him. There’s nothing Tanenbaum could do, since the MIT license allows this.\nErik Andersen is one of the developers of Busybox, a minimal implementation of that’s suited for embedded systems. Many companies tried to steal his code and distribute it with their unfree products, but since it’s protected under the GPL, Busybox developers were able to sue them and gain some money in the process.\nInterestingly enough, Tanenbaum doesn’t seem to mind what intel did. But there are some examples out there of people regretting releasing their work under a permissive license.\nReferences:\nhttps://lemmy.world/comment/10690861\nIn short: permissive licenses can look generous, but they make it easier for your work to be absorbed into proprietary systems. GPL prevents that.\n\nWhat If Someone Claims My Code as Theirs?\nThis isn’t really “software piracy” — it’s plagiarism or license violation.\nFortunately, both GPL and MIT/BSD already protect you:\n\nGPL: They must keep your name and license notice. Removing it = license violation.\nMIT/BSD: They must credit you too. If they remove attribution, that’s also a violation.\nNo license/public domain: You have no protection; anyone can claim it.\n\nSo as long as you choose a license, you’re covered.\n\n🛡️ What Actions Can You Take?\nHere’s a step-by-step action checklist if you find a violation:\nStep 1: Gather Evidence\n\nSave screenshots of your repo with timestamps.\nSave screenshots/links of the infringing project.\n\nStep 2: Contact Them\nSend a polite but firm notice. Example:\n\n“Your project [link] uses my code from [link] but does not comply with GPLv3. Please restore attribution and comply with the license within 7 days.”\n\nStep 3: Public Exposure\nIf ignored, make it public. Post an issue or blog about the violation. Communities often side with the original author.\nStep 4: DMCA Takedown\nFile a takedown with the hosting platform (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).\n\nGitHub DMCA portal: https://github.com/github/dmca\n\nStep 5: Legal Enforcement\nIf it’s a company profiting from your work:\n\nSend a cease-and-desist letter.\nIf needed, escalate to a copyright infringement lawsuit.\nThe Free Software Foundation (FSF) can sometimes assist with GPL cases: https://www.fsf.org/licensing\n\n\nReady-to-Use Templates\nEmail to Violator\n\nDMCA Takedown Request\n\nConclusion\nChoosing the GPL is not just about protecting yourself — it’s about protecting users’ freedom.\nWith GPL, your work remains open, and violators risk real legal consequences.\nWith MIT/BSD, your name must stay, but your code can still be locked away inside proprietary software.\nWith no license, you give up all control.\n\n","id":"https://mukund.xyz/blog/why-i-use-the-gpl/","title":"Why I Use the GPL"},"https://mukund.xyz/notes/":{"body":"","id":"https://mukund.xyz/notes/","title":"List of Notes"},"https://mukund.xyz/notes/90-days-of-learing-react/":{"body":"This blog is where I will document my journey of learning React over the next 90 days. Each day, I will focus on a specific topic or concept, and share my notes, code snippets, and resources.\n\n  \n\nDay 1: Introduction to React\n\nWhat is React?\n\nA JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\nDeveloped by Facebook and released in 2013.\nFocuses on building reusable UI components.\n\n\nKey Features:\n\nVirtual DOM for efficient rendering.\nComponent-based architecture.\nSingle Page Application (SPA) capabilities.\n\n\n\nSetup and Installation\n\nInstall Node.js and npm.\nCreate a new React app using Create React App:\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can set up a React project using Vite for faster development:\n\n\nStructure of a React App:\n\nDay 2: JSX and Rendering Elements\nJSX (JavaScript XML)\nApp.jsx\n\nNav.jsx\n\nmain.jsx\n\nKey Points\nComponent should  start with an uppercase letter, and the file name should match the component name. This is a convention in React to differentiate components from regular HTML elements.\nWe can name both App.js &amp; App.jsx but in vite development environment we have to use jsx\nWe can return only one component by a jsx function so it’s good to wrap in &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; or \nDay 3: Create own Custom components\nCreating Custom components\nscript.js\n\nindex.html\n\nCreate a custom component in React that renders an anchor tag with a link to your website.\nmain.jsx\n\nDays 4 Hooks and State Management\nHooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. They allow you to manage state, lifecycle events, and side effects without writing class components.\n\nuseState Hook\n\nAllows you to add state to functional components.\nReturns an array with the current state and a function to update it.\nHooks can’t be called inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. They should be called at the top level of your component.\n\n\n\nDay 5: Virtual DOM and Reconciliation\nReact Fiber Architecture is an ongoing reimplementation of React’s core algorithm. It is the culmination of over two years of research by the React team.\nVirtual dom\nVirtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where a virtual representation of the UI is kept in memory and synced with the real DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.\nWhat is reconciliation?\n\nreconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a component’s state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree and compares it with the previous one. It then calculates the most efficient way to update the real DOM to match the new Virtual DOM.\nKey Terms\nOther key features include the\nability to pause,\nabort, or reuse work as new updates come in\nthe ability to assign priority to different types of updates\nand new concurrency primitives.\nThe algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.\n\n  \n\nReconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the “virtual DOM.”\nA high-level description goes something like this: when you render a React application, a tree of nodes that describes the app is generated and saved in memory. This tree is then flushed to the rendering environment — for example, in the case of a browser application, it’s translated to a set of DOM operations. When the app is updated (usually via setState), a new tree is generated. The new tree is diffed with the previous tree to compute which operations are needed to update the rendered app.\n\nAlthough Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n\nDifferent component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree completely.\n\n\nDiffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be “stable, predictable, and unique.”\n\n\nIn Array Why keys should be introduced?\n\nIn Fiber algorithm if we want to impove performance of list when itrating over array of items  we should use keys.\n\nWhen React sees a list of elements, it needs to determine which items have changed, been added, or been removed. Keys help React identify which items in the list correspond to which elements in the previous render.\nScheduling\n\nthe process of determining when work should be performed.\n\nThe key points are:\n\nIn a UI, it’s not necessary for every update to be applied immediately; in fact, doing so can be wasteful, causing frames to drop and degrading the user experience.\nDifferent types of updates have different priorities — an animation update needs to complete more quickly than, say, an update from a data store.\nA push-based approach requires the app (you, the programmer) to decide how to schedule work. A pull-based approach allows the framework (React) to be smart and make those decisions for you.\n\nWhat is a fiber?\nWe’ve established that a primary goal of Fiber is to enable React to take advantage of scheduling. Specifically, we need to be able to\n\npause work and come back to it later.\nassign priority to different types of work.\nreuse previously completed work.\nabort work if it’s no longer needed.\n\nStructure of a Fiber\nIn concrete terms, a fiber is a JavaScript object that contains information about a component, its input, and its output.\nA fiber corresponds to a stack frame, but it also corresponds to an instance of a component.\nHere are some of the important fields that belong to a fiber. (This list is not exhaustive.)\ntype and key\nDay 6: Props for  Component Communication\nProps (short for “properties”) are a way to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React. They are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.\nFunction and Class Components\nThe simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:\n\nThis function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.\nYou can also use an ES6 class to define a component:\n\nThe above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.\nHow to create Parents and Child components using props\nParentCard.jsx\n\nCard.jsx\n\nDay 7: useState Hook in Depth\nThe useState hook is a fundamental building block in React that allows you to add state to functional components. It provides a way to manage and update state within your components without the need for class components.\n\nUnderstanding State\n\nDefinition: State is data in an application that changes over time . In React, this means data that can be different from one component render to another .\nImportance: Tracking state is crucial for application functionality, such as showing a loading spinner while fetching data, displaying error messages, or handling the data itself .\n\nThe useState Hook\n\nPurpose: useState is the primary hook used in functional components to manage and manipulate state in React .\nHow to Import: You must import the hook from React: import { useState } from ‘react’ .\n\nuseState Syntax and Structure\n\nThe hook is used by destructuring an array that contains two elements:\n\n\nState Variable (count): The current value of the state .\n\n\nUpdater Function (setCount): A function used to update the state variable .\n\n\nNaming Convention: By convention, the updater function is named set followed by the name of the state variable (e.g., setCount) .\nDefault Value: The value passed as an argument to useState() is the initial or default value of the state. If no value is provided, the state will be undefined .\nJavaScript\n\n\nstate: The current state value.\nsetState: A function that allows you to update the state.\ninitialState: The initial value of the state.\n\nExample of useState Hook for Background Color Change on Button Click\n\nExplanation\n\nWe import the useState hook from React.\nWe define a functional component App.\nWe use the useState hook to create a state variable colorbg with an initial value of “Black”.\nWe create buttons that, when clicked, update the colorbg state to different colors.\nThe background color of the div changes based on the current value of colorbg.\n\nKey points\n\nThe useState hook can be called multiple times in a single component to manage different pieces of state.\nState updates are asynchronous, so the new state value may not be immediately available after calling the setState function.\nYou can pass a function to the setState function if you need to update the state based on the previous state.\n\nExample of updating state based on previous state\n\nThis ensures that you are working with the most up-to-date state value, especially when multiple state updates are queued.\nConclusion\nThe useState hook is a powerful and essential tool for managing state in React functional Components. It allows you to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces by enabling stateful behavior in your components.\nDay 8: useEffect, useRef and useCallback Hooks\nuseEffect Hook\nWhat is useEffect ?\nIt is a hook from react to perform side effects in out application.\nside effects you can think of about them as name implies  as things happening as consequence of something else happening in your application like fetching data from an API, setting up a subscription, or manually changing the DOM in React components.\nhow to use it ?\nwhen to use it ?\nhow it works ?\nThe useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in your functional components. Side effects can include data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The useEffect hook runs after the component renders.\nSyntax\n\n\n\nThe first argument is a function that contains the side effect code.\n\n\nThe second argument is an optional array of dependencies. The effect will only re-run if one of the dependencies has changed.\n\n\nit is guaranteed that the useEffect function will run at least once when our component mounts.And no matter what you pass as dependencies.\n\n\nuseRef Hook\nThe useRef hook allows you to create a mutable reference that persists across renders. It can be used to access DOM elements directly or to store any mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.\nSyntax\n\n\nref: The mutable reference object.\ninitialValue: The initial value of the reference.\n\nuseCallback Hook\nThe useCallback hook returns a memoized version of a callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. It is useful for optimizing performance by preventing unnecessary re-creations of functions.\nSyntax\n\n\nThe first argument is the callback function.\nThe second argument is an array of dependencies. The callback will only be re-created if one of the dependencies has changed.\n\nExample using useEffect, useRef, and useCallback\n\nDay 9: Project password generator using React\n\nExplanation\n\nWe use the useState hook to manage various state variables such as length, allowedCharacter, allowedNumber, password, and copied.\nThe generatePassword function generates a random password based on the selected criteria.\nThe useEffect hook is used to automatically generate a new password whenever the length, allowedCharacter, or allowedNumber state changes.\nThe copyToClipboard function copies the generated password to the clipboard and shows a “Copied!” message for 1.5 seconds.\nThe UI includes input elements for selecting password length and options for including characters and numbers, as well as buttons for generating and copying the password.\n\n","id":"https://mukund.xyz/notes/90-days-of-learing-react/","title":"90 Days of Learning React"},"https://mukund.xyz/notes/concurrency-is-not-what-you-think/":{"body":"Have you ever wondered how your computer can run multiple programs at the same time?\nMost people think of multi-core CPUs, which is understandable with the marketing push from CPU manufacturers. However, the ability to multitask has been around since the days of single-core processors.\nA Historical Perspective\nBack in the 1980s, machines like the Commodore Amiga and Apple Macintosh could already run multiple programs at once—even with only one processor.\n\n  \n\nTo understand how, we need to go back further.\nMainframes and Limited Access\n\n  \n\nEarly computers were massive and expensive machines called mainframes. They filled entire rooms and were only accessible to governments, big companies, and universities. Due to their high cost and complexity, computer time was highly valuable.\nOperating a program on these machines wasn’t simple:\n\nLoad the compiler (often from magnetic tape).\nInput the source code (e.g., in Fortran).\nGenerate Assembly code.\nUse an assembler to produce machine code.\nFinally, execute the program.\n\nEach step involved manual tape mounting and waiting, during which the CPU sat idle, even though other users couldn’t access it.\nThe Birth of Operating Systems\nTo improve efficiency, researchers created early operating systems that enabled multiple users to connect via devices like teletypes or dumb terminals.\nThis led to time-sharing systems, where the operating system would switch between users’ programs, keeping the CPU busy and maximizing the value of expensive computers.\n\nConcurrency in Single-CPU Systems\nA CPU executes one instruction at a time, but it does so incredibly fast which gives the illusion of simultaneous execution. This is the core idea of concurrency.\n\nEven with one CPU, computers can appear to run many processes at once by rapidly switching between them.\n\nSystems like Multics (developed in the 1960s) were pioneers in this approach.\n\n  \n\nrefrence\nLater, personal computers adopted similar techniques to serve multiple users, but to allow a single user to run multiple applications.\n\nHow CPUs Execute Instructions\nAt a low level, the CPU operates in a fetch-decode-execute cycle:\n\nThe address register holds the memory location of the next instruction.\nThe instruction is fetched and moved to the instruction register.\nThe CPU decodes and executes the instruction.\nThe address register is updated to point to the next instruction.\n\nJump instructions allow for loops and conditions, by modifying the address register manually.\nThis means programs don’t need to be split in memory—the operating system changes the CPU’s state to switch between processes.\n\nScheduling and Process Management\nOnce a program starts running, it becomes a process.\nThe OS uses a queue to manage all active processes. Two key components handle this:\n\nScheduler: Determines which process should run next.\nDispatcher: Loads the selected process into the CPU.\n\nBut When Does the OS Run?\nPrograms often rely on the OS for tasks like file access or memory allocation. These are handled through interruptions.\nWhen an interrupt occurs (e.g., from an I/O request):\n\nThe CPU saves the current process’s state.\nIt jumps to the interrupt service routine (ISR) in OS memory.\nThe OS handles the request and schedules the next process.\n\nThis is how the OS regains control of the CPU.\n\nThe Problem With Cooperative Scheduling\nOriginally, systems used cooperative scheduling:\n\nA process keeps the CPU until it voluntarily gives it up.\nThis can lead to problems if a process enters an infinite loop with no I/O.\nThe OS never regains control, potentially locking the system.\n\nThis method is insecure, especially with malicious programs.\n\nEnter Preemptive Scheduling\nTo solve this, hardware support is essential.\nA hardware timer is introduced:\n\nBefore assigning the CPU to a process, the OS sets the timer.\nIf the timer expires, it automatically triggers an interrupt.\nThis forces the CPU to return control to the OS.\n\n\nPreemptive scheduling allows the OS to interrupt any process and regain CPU control—even if the process doesn’t cooperate.\n\nModern systems, including versions of Windows from 95 onward, use this method. Interestingly, Multics supported it in the 1960s!\n\nWhat About Multi-core Systems?\nMultitasking on a single core uses concurrency to simulate parallel execution.\nHowever, as the number of processes grows, delays become noticeable.\nHardware Solution: Multi-core CPUs\n\nEach core can handle a process independently.\nThis enables true parallelism.\n\nYet, even in multi-core systems, concurrency is still crucial—because we often have more processes than cores.\n\nFinal Thought\n\nConcurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.\nParallelism is about doing lots of things at once.\n\n\n","id":"https://mukund.xyz/notes/concurrency-is-not-what-you-think/","title":"How Single-CPU Systems Multitask"},"https://mukund.xyz/notes/quantitative-aptitude/":{"body":"\n  \n\nQuantitative Aptitude\nA comprehensive guide to mastering quantitative aptitude, covering essential concepts, problem-solving techniques, and practice questions.\nTime and Work\nTime and Work problems are a common topic in quantitative aptitude tests. They involve calculating the time taken to complete a task when multiple workers are involved or determining how much work can be done in a given time.\nInvert Trick\nThe Invert Trick is a useful technique for solving Time and Work problems. It involves inverting the relationship between time and work to simplify calculations. For example, if a worker can complete a task in 5 days, their work rate is 1/5 of the task per day.\nExample Problem\n\nIf A can complete a task in 4 days and B can complete the same task in 6 days, how long will it take for both A and B to complete the task together?\n\nSolution:\nA’s work rate = 1/4 per day\nB’s work rate = 1/6 per day\nCombined work rate = 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12 per day\nTime taken together = 1 / (5/12) = 12/5 = 2.4 days\n\nA can work 5 times faster than B. If A can complete a task in 60 days less than b to complete the work , in how many days does A and B individually complete the work?\nSolution:\nLet the time taken by B to complete the work be x days.\nThen, the time taken by A to complete the work is (x - 60) days.\n\n","id":"https://mukund.xyz/notes/quantitative-aptitude/","title":"Quantitative Aptitude"},"https://mukund.xyz/project/":{"body":"","id":"https://mukund.xyz/project/","title":"List of Projects"},"https://mukund.xyz/project/wireframe/":{"body":"Wireframe Tool Project Report\nInstitute: Birla Vishvakarma Mahavidyalaya\nProject Repo\nGroup Members:\n\nMukund Parmar (23CP014)\nJaivik Prajapati (23CP002)\n\nSnapshots\nHome Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nLogin and Signup Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nDashboard Page\n\nSend verification email\nEdit or delete draft\nCreate new drafts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\nEditor Page\n\nName and create drafts\nView/search all drafts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n1.
