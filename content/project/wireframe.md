## 1. Introduction

The **Wireframe Tool** is a web-based application designed to assist UI/UX designers in creating wireframes efficiently. The tool provides an infinite canvas where users can collaboratively design, modify, and share wireframes. It is developed using the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and aims to streamline the design process with real-time collaboration features.


## 2. Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to create an intuitive and feature-rich wireframe design tool that allows users to design interfaces collaboratively.

### What is a Wireframe?

A wireframe is a simple sketch or blueprint that shows the basic layout of a website or app.

### Why Use Wireframes?

- Clarify ideas.
- Get early feedback.
- Save time.
- Focus on function.

### Benefits of Using Wireframes

- Improves user experience.
- Faster changes.
- Clearer development.
- Saves costs.

### Objectives

- Provide an infinite canvas for designing wireframes.
- Enable real-time collaboration through link-based sharing.
- Store and retrieve wireframe data efficiently.
- Offer an easy-to-use UI without coding knowledge.
