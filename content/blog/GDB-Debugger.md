When your code is running but not working at that time we mostly check line by line code it cant find any clue.

The best way to check your code line by line and what code acutally do internally, when you run the code.

so anyway let's start by installing GDB debugger in computer .

To install on Ubuntu 
```
sudo apt install gdb
```
To install on arch 
```
sudo pacman -S gdb
```
To download on Your Machine 
`https://sourceware.org/gdb/download/`

You can also use it online `https://www.onlinegdb.com/`


How to run GDB

- Run Your complier
```
$ g++ -g program
```
- Run Your gdb
```
$ gdb a.out
```
you will get output something like
