## 90 Days of Learning React
This blog is where I will document my journey of learning React over the next 90 days. Each day, I will focus on a specific topic or concept, and share my notes, code snippets, and resources.
### Day 1: Introduction to React
- **What is React?**
  - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - Developed by Facebook and released in 2013.
  - Focuses on building reusable UI components.
- **Key Features:**
    - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
    - Component-based architecture.
    - Single Page Application (SPA) capabilities.
#### Setup
- Install Node.js and npm.
- Create a new React app using Create React App:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```
- Alternatively, you can set up a React project using Vite for faster development:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app --template React
cd my-app
npm install 
npm run dev 
```
