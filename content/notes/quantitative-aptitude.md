# Quantitative Aptitude 
A comprehensive guide to mastering quantitative aptitude, covering essential concepts, problem-solving techniques, and practice questions. 

## Time and Work 
Time and Work problems are a common topic in quantitative aptitude tests. They involve calculating the time taken to complete a task when multiple workers are involved or determining how much work can be done in a given time. 
### Invert Trick 
The Invert Trick is a useful technique for solving Time and Work problems. It involves inverting the relationship between time and work to simplify calculations. For example, if a worker can complete a task in 5 days, their work rate is 1/5 of the task per day. 
### Example Problem 
1) If A can complete a task in 4 days and B can complete the same task in 6 days, how long will it take for both A and B to complete the task together? 

**Solution:** 

A's work rate = 1/4 per day 

B's work rate = 1/6 per day 

Combined work rate = 1/4 + 1/6 = 5/12 per day 

Time taken together = 1 / (5/12) = 12/5 = 2.4 days 

2) A can work 5 times faster than B. If A can complete a task in 60 days less than b to complete the work , in how many days does A and B individually complete the work?
**Solution:** 
Let the time taken by B to complete the work be x days. 
Then, the time taken by A to complete the work is (x - 60) days.
